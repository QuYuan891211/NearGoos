          <h4>
            NEAR (North-East Asian Regional)-GOOS is a regional pilot project of
            GOOS in the North-East Asian Region, implemented by China, Japan,
            the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation as one activity of
            IOC Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC). NEAR-GOOS was
            conceived and initiated upon the formal adoption of the NEAR-GOOS
            Implementation Plan and Operational Manual the Intergovernmental
            Oceanographic Commission following a recommendation from the WESTPAC
            Regional Sub commission of IOC earlier in the year. It became one of
            the first regional pilot projects of GOOS. The primary aim of
            NEAR-GOOS in its first phase was to facilitate the sharing of
            oceanographic data gathered by agencies of the partner countries
            using the internet, to support the daily mapping of conditions in
            the marginal seas bordered by the partner countries. Although it was
            anticipated that this should eventually lead to improvement in the
            availability of information and ocean services for all kinds of
            beneficial purposes, it is important to note that these flow-on
            outcomes were not specific goals for the first phase.

            The goals of NEAR-GOOS in its second phase is to development of a
            basic integrated ocean observing and operational forecasting system
            in the NEAR-GOOS area adhering to the GOOS Principles and building
            on the data management and exchange mechanisms developed in the
            first phase through the inclusion of additional parameters,
            increased coverage in space and time, the generation of a generic
            suite of data products and adequate quality control and quality
            assurance procedures.

              The mission of NEAR-GOOS in its second phase is to develop a
              comprehensive and sustained ocean observing network in the
              North-East regional seas and coastal regions, especially focused
              on observations, monitoring and other activities that cannot be
              easily implemented by countries acting independently. This network
              will embrace a wide range of data types and will be accompanied by
              the participating members and as a contribution to the GOOS and
              other global observing initiatives.
