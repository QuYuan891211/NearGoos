        <h1>NEAR-GOOS</h1>
        <h4>
          NEAR (North-East Asian Regional)-GOOS is a regional pilot project of
          GOOS in the North-East Asian Region, implemented by China, Japan, the
          Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation as one activity of IOC
          Sub-Commission for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC). NEAR-GOOS was
          conceived and initiated upon the formal adoption of the NEAR-GOOS
          Implementation Plan and Operational Manual the Intergovernmental
          Oceanographic Commission following a recommendation from the WESTPAC
          Regional Sub commission of IOC earlier in the year. It became one of
          the first regional pilot projects of GOOS. The primary aim of
          NEAR-GOOS in its first phase was to facilitate the sharing of
          oceanographic data gathered by agencies of the partner countries using
          the internet, to support the daily mapping of conditions in the
          marginal seas bordered by the partner countries. Although it was
          anticipated that this should eventually lead to improvement in the
          availability of information and ocean services for all kinds of
          beneficial purposes, it is important to note that these flow-on
          outcomes were not specific goals for the first phase.

          The goals of NEAR-GOOS in its second phase is to development of a
          basic integrated ocean observing and operational forecasting system in
          the NEAR-GOOS area adhering to the GOOS Principles and building on the
          data management and exchange mechanisms developed in the first phase
          through the inclusion of additional parameters, increased coverage in
          space and time, the generation of a generic suite of data products and
          adequate quality control and quality assurance procedures.

            The mission of NEAR-GOOS in its second phase is to develop a
            comprehensive and sustained ocean observing network in the
            North-East regional seas and coastal regions, especially focused on
            observations, monitoring and other activities that cannot be easily
            implemented by countries acting independently. This network will
            embrace a wide range of data types and will be accompanied by the
            participating members and as a contribution to the GOOS and other
            global observing initiatives.
